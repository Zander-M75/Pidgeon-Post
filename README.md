*When email is too fast and regular mail is too reliable, choose Pigeon Post!*

## About
Pigeon Post is a revolutionary supply-chain and delivery service that's taking transportation back to basics. Why trust modern technology when you can trust nature's original delivery system? Our fleet of highly-trained* pigeons is ready to maybe deliver your packages somewhere in the general vicinity of your intended destination.

(*Training consists of feeding them breadcrumbs and hoping for the best)

- 📦 Package size limited to "whatever a pigeon can carry"
- 🗺️ Delivery tracking (we watch the sky really hard)
- ⏰ Delivery times ranging from "eventually" to "who knows"
- 🌧️ Weather-dependent service (pigeons don't like rain)
- 🥖 Eco-friendly: Our workforce runs on breadcrumbs
